		<h1>Hello Web Tech</h1>
		
		<h4>Web Technologies, as a module, focuses on the tools and technologies involved in the client side of the web, that is everything that happens in the browser.</h4>
		
			<p>In this module we’re going to break down our existing web skills, fill in any gaps we identify, and then reassemble everything into a robust and extensible toolkit for building, 
			using, and exploiting web-based technologies. We will mostly focus on the client side, developing strong skills for designing and implementing web sites & web applications that run in the user’s web browser. 
			We'll supplement this with a look at Browser APIs and Web APIs. We’ll support these skills with knowledge of design and development methodologies that enable us to document and communicate our ideas to others, 
			as well as a practical understanding of the web standards and  accessibility considerations that underpin professional operation in this area. Finally, we'll consider what's involved in deploying & serving our 
			websites and what it means for a site to be "web scale"</p>
